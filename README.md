# Stock Price Forecasting for AAPL

### Introduction
This project aims to forecast stock prices for AAPL (Apple Inc.) using two different models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The stock price data is obtained from the yfinance library.

### Data Source
The stock price data for AAPL is obtained from the yfinance library, which provides historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

### Data Exploration
Upon exploration, it was observed that the stock price data is not stationary. Stationarity is a key assumption in time series analysis, as it ensures that the statistical properties of the data do not change over time.

### Methodology
#### ARIMA Model
ARIMA is a popular time series forecasting method that models the relationship between a series of observations and lagged observations. It consists of three components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA).

#### LSTM Model
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. It is capable of capturing long-term dependencies and nonlinear patterns in sequential data.

#### Preprocessing Steps
Before training the models, the data is preprocessed to achieve stationarity. This may include scaling, differencing, or other transformations to stabilize the mean and variance of the data over time.

#### Model Training and Evaluation
Both the ARIMA and LSTM models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Results
The forecasted stock prices obtained from both models are compared, along with any evaluation metrics used to assess their performance. Insights gained from comparing the models are discussed.

### Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Install the required Python libraries.
2. Obtain the stock price data using the yfinance library.
3. Run the code to train the ARIMA and LSTM models and generate forecasted prices.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the process of forecasting stock prices for AAPL using ARIMA and LSTM models. The results highlight the differences in forecasted prices between the two models and provide insights into their performance.

### Future Work
Future improvements to the project may include experimenting with different models, incorporating additional features, or fine-tuning model parameters to improve forecasting accuracy.
